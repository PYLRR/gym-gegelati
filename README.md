# gym-wrapper
The purpose of this repository is to link the TPG [GEGELATI library](https://github.com/gegelati/gegelati) to the [gym environment](https://gym.openai.com).

gym is a python library. As a result, it needs a special binding to be used in C++. To do so, http binding is used : it needs a server from the python side, and a client (using curl) from the C++ side. The code of these two components has been taken from [gym-http-api](https://github.com/openai/gym-http-api), before being modified in accordance to the free software licence.

To finish, the http api uses another library to read the json http answers : [jsoncpp](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp).

## How to install ?
First of all, install the [GEGELATI library](https://github.com/gegelati/gegelati). 
To do so, execute the following commands :
```
$ git clone https://github.com/gegelati/gegelati.git
$ cd gegelati/bin
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build . --target INSTALL # On Windows
$ cmake --build . --target install # On Linux
```

Then, clone this [project](https://github.com/PYLRR/gym-gegelati).
```
$ git clone https://github.com/PYLRR/gym-gegelati.git
```

The python part needs some dependencies. 
```
$ cd gym-gegelati/server-python
$ pip install -Ir requirements.txt 
```

## How to use ?
Start the python server:
```
$ cd gym-gegelati/server-python
$ python3 gym_http_server.py
```

Then, simply use the main of the C++ side. This will use a "Learning Agent" from Gegelati and make it work on Gym by communicating with the python server.
